    <!-- Notes for developers:
         - This file is a template; opening it directly will look blank because
           React hasn’t mounted yet.
         - You can add meta tags, analytics, or webfonts here. Keep it lean—
           heavy scripts and blocking CSS will slow down your first paint.
         - Local references must live in the public/ folder. Use %PUBLIC_URL%
           when linking so paths resolve correctly after a production build.
         - Common commands:
             * npm start / yarn start  -> run the dev server with hot reload
             * npm run build / yarn build -> create an optimized production bundle
